# 3D Car Racing Game

## Project Overview
The **3D Car Racing Game** is a web-based racing simulation utilizing Three.js for rendering 3D graphics. The game allows players to control a car on a simple track, featuring basic physics for acceleration, deceleration, and steering. With a user-friendly interface and engaging gameplay, players can compete against their own lap times.

## Installation
To get started with the 3D Car Racing Game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Car-Racing-Game.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 3D-Car-Racing-Game
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html   # On macOS
   start index.html  # On Windows
   ```

## Usage
1. Once the game loads, you will see a start screen with a "START RACE" button.
2. Click the button to begin the race. Use the following key controls:
   - **Arrow Up (↑) / W**: Accelerate
   - **Arrow Down (↓) / S**: Decelerate
   - **Arrow Left (←) / A**: Steer left
   - **Arrow Right (→) / D**: Steer right
3. Monitor your speed and lap number on the HUD.

## Features
- A basic 3D racing environment built with Three.js.
- Responsive controls for acceleration, steering, and braking.
- Simple user interface displaying speed and lap number.
- Smooth animations and transitions for an immersive experience.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following libraries:
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout.

These libraries are included through CDN links directly in the `index.html` file.

## Project Structure
```

│
├── index.html       # Main HTML file for the game
├── style.css        # Custom styles for the game UI
└── script.js        # JavaScript file containing game logic and functionality
```
- **index.html**: The main entry point of the game, containing the HTML structure and linking necessary scripts and styles.
- **style.css**: Contains custom styles that are not covered by Tailwind CSS, including animations and UI styling.
- **script.js**: Houses the core game logic, including initialization of the game, car dynamics, event handling, and animation loop.

## Conclusion
The 3D Car Racing Game is a simple yet fun project to demonstrate the capabilities of WebGL through Three.js, combined with a responsive user interface made easy with Tailwind CSS. Feel free to modify and enhance the game to add more features or improve the gameplay experience! Enjoy racing!
